   cd credit-card-validator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

## How It Works

1. Enter a **credit card number** in the input field.
2. Select the **cardholder's name** and additional details.
3. Click on **Validate**.
4. The app checks the validity of the card number using the **Luhn Algorithm** and provides instant feedback.

## API Integration

This application communicates with a Nest.js backend for server-side validation. The frontend sends a POST request with the credit card details.

```javascript
const response = await axios.post('/validate', {
  cardNumber: '4111111111111111',
});
console.log(response.data.valid); // true or false
```

## Testing

The app uses **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to ensure functionality and performance.

- Run the tests:

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- View the test coverage:

  ```bash
  npm run test:cov
  ```
